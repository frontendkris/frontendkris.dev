# Personal Portfolio – frontendkris.dev
This portfolio showcases a broad range of skills and projects I have worked on. It stands as a testament to my experience as a front-end developer. Here, you will find examples of various projects, from simple websites to advanced web applications.

## Technologies
- Astro - A modern framework providing speed and efficiency, ideal for creating a responsive and dynamic portfolio.
- TypeScript - Used to ensure strong typing and to enhance code readability and security, and most importantly, easier debugging. Also, for consistency in technology names.
- React – For dynamic sections. I utilize the island architecture offered by Astro.
- Tailwind CSS - I style fastest with it.
